# Problems

Currently reading the sensor values via Robot::Sensor::refresh() produces somehow
wrong values (the values change according to the surroundings, but are numerically
much worse than in the last commit).
My hunch says me, that this is a problem of the "force mode" of the VEML6040.
I fixed the code, so that everyting LOOKS correct to me.
Relevant funtions are in `lib/robot/src/sensor.cpp` (`refresh` and `read_color`).
